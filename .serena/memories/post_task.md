# Post-Task Checklist
- Run automated tests: npm test (jest-expo)
- For UI changes, sanity check via npm start on target platform(s) (web/ios/android) and verify light/dark themes.
- Ensure new strings have i18n keys and translations added to /locales/*.
- Verify subscription guards for features that require Basic and vehicle income flag logic.
- Keep PRD alignment; update PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md if requirements change.
- Commit with concise message after verifying workspace is clean (package-lock present → npm flow).
